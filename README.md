## Smart XO 
This is a text based version of xo which you can play against the computer. 
As you probably know, this game has a *not-losing* strategy, 
so you can't win against computer. (and probably computer can not beat you too)

### What is the purpose of this project?
This is used as an example to teach programming to high school students. 
This program is a pretty good entry-level mini-project,
as it included a range of important basic concepts like:
    
- Working with lists, tuples and dictionaries
- Input and output
- for/while loops
- Recursive functions
- Modular design of classes and functions
- Unit tests
